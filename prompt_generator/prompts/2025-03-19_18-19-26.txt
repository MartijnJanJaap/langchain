when someone presses the button auto select. I want to send the file structure and the prompt to openai. together with the following text: Give me the absolute paths to the files you think are related to be involved with the prompt. Just give me the list withouth any text

In a new file/class I want to call open ai's cheapest model using this api key SOMEKEY

the response of openai needs to by parsed and the method should return a list of strings

example code: 
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    # defaults to os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    api_key="private",
)

def chat_gpt(prompt):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
