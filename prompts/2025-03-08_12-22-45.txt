I have my own stock_tracker app. Using python I generate html to display csv files which the stock_tracker.py generates. The view.html is auto generated through generate_html.py
I want the generate_html.py to generate not a html page. but an angular app with different components. install npm and ng through python. I want to start the application through npm start
